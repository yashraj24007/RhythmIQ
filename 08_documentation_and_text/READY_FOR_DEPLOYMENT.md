# 🚀 RhythmIQ - Ready for Deployment!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **CMD Window Issue** ✅
- **Problem**: Command prompt window was opening when starting the web application
- **Solution**: Modified `start-services.ps1` to use `-WindowStyle Hidden`
- **Result**: Services now run in background without visible windows

### 2. **Deployment Readiness** ✅
Created complete deployment setup for cloud hosting:
- ✅ `render.yaml` - Render.com deployment configuration
- ✅ `requirements-api.txt` - Python API dependencies
- ✅ `application-prod.properties` - Java production configuration
- ✅ Updated Python API to read PORT from environment
- ✅ Complete deployment guide with multiple hosting options

## 🎯 How to Deploy to Render (Recommended)

### Why Render?
- ✅ **Free tier available** (with limitations)
- ✅ Supports both Python and Java
- ✅ Auto-deploys from GitHub
- ✅ Free SSL certificates
- ✅ Easy environment variable management

### Deployment Steps:

#### 1. **Commit Your Code to GitHub**
```bash
cd E:\Projects\RhythmIQ
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Render deployment"
git push origin main
```

#### 2. **Create Render Account**
- Go to https://render.com
- Sign up with GitHub

#### 3. **Create New Blueprint**
- Click "New +" button
- Select "Blueprint"
- Connect your GitHub repository: `yashraj24007/RhythmIQ`
- Render will automatically detect `render.yaml`

#### 4. **Configure Services**
Render will create 2 services:
- **rhythmiq-ml-api** (Python) - Your ML model
- **rhythmiq-webapp** (Java) - Your web interface

#### 5. **Deploy!**
- Click "Apply"
- Wait for build and deployment (~5-10 minutes)
- Your app will be live!

**Free Tier Note**: Services sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity. First request takes ~30 seconds to wake up.

## 🌐 Your Live URLs (After Deployment)

- **Web Application**: `https://rhythmiq-webapp.onrender.com`
- **ML API**: `https://rhythmiq-ml-api.onrender.com`

---

## 🔧 Local Development (No CMD Window)

### Start Services:
```powershell
cd E:\Projects\RhythmIQ
.\start-services.ps1
```

Both services will now run **hidden in background** - no CMD windows!

### Stop Services:
```powershell
.\stop-services.ps1
```

### Access Locally:
- **Web App**: http://localhost:8082
- **ML API**: http://localhost:8083/health

## 📊 Alternative Hosting Options

See `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for complete guides on:

### ✅ Railway.app
- Similar to Render
- Good free tier
- Easy GitHub integration

### ✅ Docker + Any Cloud
Complete Docker setup provided for:
- AWS ECS/Fargate
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Apps
- DigitalOcean App Platform

### ❌ NOT Recommended:
- **Vercel**: Doesn't support Java/Python backends
- **Netlify**: Static sites only
- **GitHub Pages**: Static sites only

```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Model File Size
Your `05_trained_models/rythmguard_model.joblib` must be in Git repository or uploaded separately to Render.

**If it's too large for Git** (>100MB):
1. Store it in cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
2. Download it during startup in `load_model()` function

### Environment Variables (Set in Render)
- `PORT` - Auto-set by Render
- `PYTHON_API_URL` - Auto-linked between services
- `UPLOAD_DIR` - Use `/tmp/rhythmiq-uploads` in production

### Free Tier Limitations
- Services sleep after 15 minutes inactivity
- 750 hours/month free (enough for 1 service running 24/7)
- Cold starts take ~30 seconds
- **For production**: Upgrade to paid tier ($7/month per service)

---

## 🎉 Summary

### ✅ CMD Window Issue - FIXED
Services now run hidden in background on your local machine.

### ✅ Deployment Ready
Your application is now configured for cloud hosting with:
- Render.com (recommended)
- Railway.app (alternative)
- Docker (any cloud platform)

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add deployment configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Render**:
   - Create account at render.com
   - Connect GitHub repository
   - Create Blueprint from `render.yaml`
   - Wait for deployment

3. **Test Your Live App**:
   - Visit your Render dashboard
   - Click on `rhythmiq-webapp` service
   - Copy the live URL
   - Test ECG analysis!

## 📞 Need Help?

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Render Logs**:
   - Go to your service dashboard
   - Click "Logs" tab
   - Look for errors

2. **Common Issues**:
   - Model file too large → Store in cloud storage
   - Build timeout → Increase build timeout in Render settings
   - API connection failed → Check `PYTHON_API_URL` environment variable

3. **Test Locally First**:
   ```powershell
   .\stop-services.ps1
   .\start-services.ps1
   ```
   Make sure everything works on localhost before deploying.
